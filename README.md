# Fritz Jingle Maschine

This program randomly plays the famous jingles of the [Fritz radio station](https://www.fritz.de) aired in Berlin and Brandenburg, Germany.
It is meant to be executed on a Raspberry Pi (or similar mini-computer) that has a button attached to it's GPIOs. A button press triggers the playback of a randomly chosen jingle.

## Disclaimer

I am not, in any kind, related to Fritz or rbb. This is meant as a fun project to emphasize the greatness of these jingles. Since Fritz claims on it's [jingles website](https://www.fritz.de/programm/jingles/), that the jingles are "Zum Anh√∂ren, Runterladen und Weiterverschicken." (engl. "for listening, downloading and redistributing"), so a project like this one here should be no problem. The website [linkfang.org](https://de.linkfang.org/wiki/Creative_Commons) claims, that these jingles ar published under a CC-License.
